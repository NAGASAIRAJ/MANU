         Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change[Note 1] by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.
Animation creation methods include the traditional animation creation method and those involving stop motion animation of two and three-dimensional objects, paper cutouts, puppets and clay figures. Images are displayed in a rapid succession, usually 24, 25, 30, or 60 frames per second. Computer animation processes generating animated images with the general term computer-generated imagery (CGI). 3D animation uses computer graphics, while 2D animation is used for stylistic, low bandwidth and faster real-time renderings.

     Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of motion into a still drawing can be found in paleolithic cave paintings, where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.[1]
An earthen goblet discovered at the site of the 5,200-year-old Shahr-e Sukhté (Burnt City) in southeastern Iran, depicts what could possibly be the world's oldest example of animation.[2] The artifact bears five sequential images depicting a Persian Desert Ibex jumping up to eat the leaves of a tree.[3][4]
Ancient Chinese records contain several mentions of devices that were said to "give an impression of movement" to human or animal figures,[5] these accounts are unclear and may only refer to the actual movement of the figures through space.[6]

      The cinématographe was a projector, printer, and camera in one machine that allowed moving pictures to be shown successfully on a screen which was invented by history's earliest filmmakers, Auguste and Louis Lumière, in 1894.[13][14] The first animated projection (screening) was created in France, by Charles-Émile Reynaud,[13] who was a French science teacher. Reynaud created the Praxinoscope in 1877 and the Théâtre Optique in December 1888.[15] On 28 October 1892, he projected the first animation in public, Pauvre Pierrot, at the Musée Grévin in Paris.[16] This film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used. His films were not photographed, they were drawn directly onto the transparent strip.[17] In 1900, more than 500,000 people had attended these screenings.

       More detailed hand-drawn animation, requiring a team of animators drawing each frame manually with detailed backgrounds and characters, were those directed by Winsor McCay, a successful newspaper cartoonist, including the 1911 Little Nemo, the 1914 Gertie the Dinosaur,[25] and the 1918 The Sinking of the Lusitania.[26] Gertie the Dinosaur was an early example of the character development in drawn animation.[27]
During the 1910s, the production of animated short films typically referred to as "cartoons", became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters.[28] The most successful producer at the time was John Randolph Bray, who, along with animator Earl Hurd, patented the cel animation process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.[29][30]
